Improved version of T1Nstereo

This is a fork of stereosound. The youtuber lupit told me to put this or else my whole project is stolen (self projection from him) so credits to Ryan.js, Bepvte and y'know Lupit for claiming i stole everything in my project and also for him console logging the voice module and changing one function.

download the .plugin.js file then drag it into discord and ctrl r then after clicking out of the changelog menu ctrl r again to get the prompt to download zeres

join the support server through the plugin under the plugin name with the little question mark thingy if you need support or help

all of the plugin settings are on the little gear box symbols in the better discord plugin page in settings

Settings you need to turn off for this plugin to work

(all of these settings are located in voice and video settings on discord)

1: Echo Cancellation.

2: Noise Suppression.

3: Diagnostic Audio Recording.

4: Debug Logging.

5: Also for a extra kinda setting set the audio subsystem to legacy as it "has" the best audio quality out of all of the audio subsystems im not sure if thats true though, also it might pop less if you have that issue.

Im not fake claiming this the the "best" stereo plugin it does have the most customibility and settings also all of the voice bitrate settings on the other stereo plugins didnt even do it correctly lmfao so i fixxed it in this one download the plugin for all the settings
